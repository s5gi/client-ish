# client-ish
An optimized version of 1.8.9 Minecraft that implements optifine, mouse delay fix, memoryfix, hit delay fix, entity culling, and a few other tweaks. This client has also completely removed realms and twitch broadcasting from the base game.

## NOTE: 
### This project will never or ever be paid due to the nature of the project. A majority of the code in the Client is NOT mine. Thanks to LogisticsCraft for making the library OcclusionCulling (ADD LINK SOON). This project is for fun and I will NOT take any feature request from people I don't know.
